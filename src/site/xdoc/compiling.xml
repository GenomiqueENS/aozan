    <section name="How to compile Aozan">

      <p>To build Aozan, you need a <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/">Java Development Kit (JDK)</a> greater or equal to 11 and <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven</a> 3.6.x.</p>

      <p>The following command lines will work whatever your operating system is and whatever the "<code>$</code>" character representing the command line prompt is.</p>
      <p>To compile Aozan, the default memory amount allocated by Maven is not enough.
      Your have to set the environment variable <b>MAVEN_OPTS</b> to do allow a greater memory allocation.
      To change this variable using bash, use the built-in command <b>export</b>.
      Something like 512MiB or 1GiB is a good amount of memory of Maven:</p>

      <source>$ export MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx1024m</source>
      <p><b>Update:</b> The default memory amount allocated by the last version of Maven seems to be enough to build Aozan.</p>

      <p>First set your current directory to the base directory of <b>Aozan</b>.</p>

      <p>To build both source and binary distribution, type:</p>
      <source>$ mvn install</source>

      <p>To generate documentation, type:</p>
      <source>$ mvn site</source>

      <p>To generate both distributions and documentation, type:</p>
      <source>$ mvn site install</source>

      <p>To clean the build directories, type:</p>
      <source>$ mvn clean</source>
