    <section name="Welcome to Aozan">
      <p>Aozan has been developed in order to automatically handle raw data transfer, demultiplexing and quality control of a sequencing run once an Illumina sequencer run has been completed.
      This software is involved in the primary data analysis.
      Aozan produces compressed FASTQ files and a quality report from an Illumina sequencer output in order to evaluate each sequencing parameter.
      Aozan can work on most computer infrastructures and only requires a samplesheet for each run.</p>

      <p>Aozan greatly helps to improve the efficiency in the run data management and to keep tracks of the run statistics through automatic mails and HTML report pages.</p>

    <section name="Supported devices">
      <p>Aozan can handle the output of many Illumina sequencer models, however not all the models of Illumina sequencers has been tested with Aozan.
      As Illumina sequencer outputs are very similar, Aozan may work with most of the Illumina sequencers.
      You can <a href="mailto:aozan@biologie.ens.fr">contact us</a> to tell us if your sequencer model is compatible with Aozan.</p>

        <p>Optionally, Aozan adds a sub-step in FastQC to enhance the Overrepresented sequences module. For sequences with &quot;no hit&quot;, a blastn can be launch to estimate the source.
        Blastn results with 100% identity and 0% gap will be included in report.</p>

        <p>Aozan now provide a QC module that analyzes indices of reads in the undetermined FASTQ files.
        For each indices, this module suggest the sample(s) and the number of reads that can be recovered using a demultiplexing step with one more mismatch that the number of mismatches has been used.
        See for more information about this feature the <a href="qc-samples-tests.html#recoveryclusters">sample  tests section of the documentation</a>.</p>

      <subsection name="New built-in step to automatically recompress all your fastq files.">
        <p>Aozan has now a new built-in step which recompresses FASTQ files (compressed or not with gzip) into bzip2 files.
        bzip2 files are more compressed than gzip files and thus take less disk space.</p>
        <p><b>Warning</b>: The recompression step has been removed in Aozan 3.</p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Define denied runs and prioritized runs">
        <p>In the <tt>aozan.var.path</tt> directory, you can specify <tt>[step].deny</tt> files (e.g. qc.deny, demux.deny...) that contains the list of runs to not process by the step.
        You can also create in this directory a <tt>runs.priority file</tt> that contains the list of the runs to process before the others runs.
        Furthermore, when a sequencer run fail, it will be automatically added to the <tt>hiseq.deny</tt> file.</p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Aozan can now fully be executed using a Docker image.">
        <p>Aozan can now fully be executed using a Docker image.
        Thus you don't need anymore to install Aozan dependancies on your computer before using it.</p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Bcl2fastq samplesheet location">
        <p>If a bcl2fastq samplesheet is not provided in the samplesheet directory, Aozan will use if exist the <tt>Samplesheet.csv</tt> file located at the root of raw output run directory.</p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Number of mismatch for demultiplexing">

        <p>Aozan can manage several sequencers, and now handles the latest versions of Illumina sequencers (HiSeq 3/4000 and NextSeq 500).</p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Demultiplexing using docker">
        <p>Aozan can launch bcl2fastq 2.x in Docker container.

      </subsection>

      <subsection name="New include directive in configuration file">
        <p>The Aozan configuration file has been improved with a new "<code>include</code>" directive.

      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Reading Illumina InterOp binary files">
        <p>Run data are now retrieved by parsing Illumina InterOp Binary Metric files as Illumina XML run files are now deprecated.</p>
